### The Issue with dimensionality in Volume rendering:
* 02/02/2015

Ive noticed in my search for Text visualizations that there is almost nothing in
the way of Volume Rendered Text. That is, nobody has taken some text, stuffed
the data into a 3D grid, and rendered it using typical Volume Rendering
Algorithms. Whats the deal?!

I am beginning to think the reason for this is because there is no real
dimensionality to the data beyond 1D. So far every visualization of text based
data Ive seen consistently uses network graph visualizations. Obviously there is
good reason for this. Relational network graphs are a superior way of
representing the relationships found within a document, or set of documents.
Still, why cant we do the same thing but as a volume instead?
