I appreciated a point the author made when defining a Design Study, specifically
the idea that a Design study, and a visualization, should aim to solve a
**Real-World problem** with **Real-World DATA**. Ive seen enough design study
papers which, in nearly every other aspect the paper was on point except when it
came down to discussing the dataset used to evaluate the application. In nearly
every one of those papers they chose, for poorly justified reasons, to use
synthetic data in order to test their hypothesis. Perhaps in the implementation
phase of the Nine-stage framework this error could be forgiven and understood,
but at evaluation time, I think you loose (or should) all credibility when you
cant demonstrate your application with real life domain specific data. The argument
"there just wasnt enough available" suggests to me that you dont have a design
study worth publishing then. What good is a tool without a task, or problem to
solve?

Another valuable point the author makes within this paper is the notion of identifying
the task for which you visualization application seeks to accomplish and the
problem that ones visualization must solve. In reflecting on my own applications
I often find myself spending too much time thinking about the logistics of the
application and not enough on the _**purpose**_ of the application. That is,
what is it I am trying to convey by visualizing Time-dependent fMRI data? What
is the significance of the dataset that I am using and what does that data represent?

Is it enough that the domain expert has come to you seeking a tool (Visualizations
are tools, not just pretty pictures after all) that will, in their minds, garner
more and perhaps unique insight into their data? Do we as visualization experts
have a responsibility to decide when a visualization of a particular dataset,
whatever it might be, is not appropriate? Is visualizing something for the sake
of visualizing it a noble cause, or should we take a moment to step back and
think about what the end goal and gain is?

Speaking of the implementation phase, this is an area that I am still struggling
with. I am in the unique position of **being** a domain expert and having an
intimate understanding of the _need_ for an application like this, I find myself
falling into the trap of focusing too much time on *usability* and trying to code
a solution. Knowing the domain affords me the insight of knowing that people in
my domain aint got time to play with a toy application, they want something that
works and works well. I struggle to understand how deploying a barely functional
prototype to people who have much more important things to do with their time is
doing anyone any favors?
