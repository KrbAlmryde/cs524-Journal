I found this paper to be very insightful. I appreciated the tone of the paper
and her


### Context
Munzer's 2008 article "Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information
Visualization Research Papers" offers a practical and insightful guide towards
writing an effective Inofrmation Visualization paper. The aim of the paper was
to explore common pitfalls observed in papers rejected by the _IEEE_
_Visualization_ _on_ _Information_ _Visualization_ as well as provide a thorough
analysis on the process of writing an effective InfoVis research paper. It is the
authors hope that researchers of every level take advantage of this knowledge
and avoid common problems.

The author goes into great detail about the *DOs* and *DONTs* of effective
InfoVis research papers. Whats more, she speaks from experience having been the
Papers Chair of IEEE 2003 and her authors guide for new InfoVis submissions is
still in use to this day, largely unchanged.

### Contributions

This paper contributes a structure and road map towards writing effective InfoVis
papers. She provides thoughtful discussions on how best to structure a paper
depending on the nature of the project. For example, how best to structure a
*Models* paper, or a *Systems* paper amongst others, and how to know the
difference. Perhaps the most valuable contribution was her

- What are the CONTRIBUTIONS of the paper? What specifically does it present that is new and
interesting?

### Structure
 Summarize the STRUCTURE of the paper. How do the authors present their ideas? What steps do they
take to present their contributions and then convince you of the validity of these contributions?

### Results
 Discuss the RESULTS of the paper. What specific conclusions does it make? What advice does it give it
to the target audience?


### Methods
 What are the METHODS used to come to these results? Is it a user study, a survey, an interview? Does it
use statistical analyses? Do the methods make sense for the problem? Is there anything that might have
been left out? What assumptions did the authors make when they chose these methods? How many
people were involved in the user study or interview? Do you think the addition of more studies would
help convince you that their results were meaningful?

### Technologies
 What TECHNOLOGIES does the paper explore? Does the paper make sense only in terms of specific
device or technology, or would the contributions of the paper apply to multiple technologies, or even
future technology?

### Figures
 Describe the FIGURES in the paper. Do they help explain the main ideas of the paper? Do any of the
figures show some sort of interaction techniques? Could you redesign the figures so that they would be
more useful or clear? What would the authors of the Sketching User Experiences Workbook say about
them?

### Confusion
 List any words or ideas that you don’t understand or that cause CONFUSION. Look up the meaning of
these words. Do the references help you make sense of technical phrases or jargon? Provide the
definition of the words that’s relevant to the paper. If you can’t figure it out, what is your best guess?

### Evalute
 How would you EVALUTE the effectiveness of this paper and the research it describes? How do you
think the authors could build upon or improve the contributions of the paper? Is there anything that
was left out? Can you think of future research that would build upon this paper?


### Relevance
 Explain the RELEVANCE of the article toward your research interests in general and especially toward
the articles that you are writing in conjunction with this class. Before the mid-point of the semester, the papers you choose should be important precursors that can be discussed in the “related work” section
of your articles.
