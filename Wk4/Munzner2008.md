### Context
Munzer's 2008 article "Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information
Visualization Research Papers" offers a practical and insightful guide towards
writing an effective Inofrmation Visualization paper. The aim of the paper was
to explore common pitfalls observed in papers rejected by the _IEEE_
_Visualization_ _on_ _Information_ _Visualization_ as well as provide a thorough
analysis on the process of writing an effective InfoVis research paper. It is the
authors hope that researchers of every level take advantage of this knowledge
and avoid common problems.

The author goes into great detail about the **DOs** and **DONTs** of effective
InfoVis research papers. Whats more, she speaks from experience having been the
Posters Chair of IEEE 2002 and Papers Chair of IEEE 2003 and her authors guide for new InfoVis submissions,
largely unchanged, is still in use to this day.

### Contributions
This paper contributes a structure and road map towards writing effective InfoVis
papers. She provides thoughtful discussions on how best to structure a paper
depending on the nature of the project. For example, how best to structure a
**Models** paper, or a **Systems** paper amongst others, and how to know the
difference. Perhaps the most valuable contribution _(in my opinion)_ was her
discussion on pitfalls and common problems. Using _catchy_ and sometimes _snide_
titles, she lays out the dangers and pitfalls **failed** papers fall prey to,
and offers advice and guidance for how best to avoid these potential problems.
Ultimately this paper contributes a solid research guide

### Takeaways and connecting this work with my own projects
Perhaps my biggest takeaway from this paper was the notion that an effective
InfoVis paper requires a lot of thought and planning before you ever write a
single line or code. Or at least, thats how you should do it. The problem with
throwing together an idea is that you may not have a clear picture of what type of
contribution your project actually makes to the field and literature as a whole,
which can be disastrous come writing time. Furthermore, it behooves you, as a
researcher to have a thorough understanding of the literature surround your
project. Both as a means of understanding where your work fits into the grand
scheme of it all, as well as to ensure you dont make the dire mistake of missing
highly relevant literature (such as the Papers Chair's article on the same topic).

Additionally, it is important to understand that while youre project may be
really cool and groundbreaking, if you do not address the format or style of the
various InfoVis paper types, you going to have a bad time. That is to say, each
type of paper targets a very specific audience who has a very specific interest
in those types of papers. If your project is a novel method of visual encoding,
dont write a Technique paper describing the algorithm, do a Design Study paper!

#### Text Rendering
There were a few things which stood out to me within this article that I saw an
immediate relationship to with my own project. For starters, I get the sense
that my Text Rendering project is perhaps doomed to fail. Its certainly not that
I dont love the concept and find the idea exciting. Its that I cant justify on
any level (yet) what kind of contribution it makes towards visualization and the
field. As she states expertly, just because you spent time coding it, doesnt
mean you deserve a paper. The obvious solution to this problem involves examining
the literature a bit more thoroughly to ensure I actually understand the problem
I am trying to solve.

My biggest concern with this project is that it teeters dangerously close to a
visual encoding pitfall which she so aptly titles _"2D Good, 3D Better"_. Is
a 3D Volume Rendering technique the right approach? If it turns out to **NOT**
be an effective means of displaying that type of data, have I wasted my time?

### NiftiViewer
This project is an entirely different beast altogether. I have the advantage of
being a Domain expert within the field of Neuorimaging, having done it for the
last 7 years, so I am aware of the needs for a tool like this. From a research
perspective, this project most neatly falls within a design study type of paper.
However, there are major components, and road blocks, which would easily earn a
paper discussing the technique alone. Time-varying volume visualization is to
this day, an active research problem that has yet to find an adequate solution.
Considering this project is centered around visualizing 4D data using the GPU,
a lot more thought is going to have to go into this.
