#### Reflections
I think one of the most striking features of this article is how it has, for the
most part, stood the test of time. In some cases I think that problems that have
been listed in this article have since been addressed here now in 2015 that at
the time of the writing were still a concern. Namely, Inter-disciplinary
collaborations has become a mainstay of modern Visualization research. I cant
think of many projects that have not arisen from some kind of collaboration. Take
for example, my own project "3D Brain View + Time" stemmed from a collaboration
with Brain Imaging experts seeking a tool in which they could view fMRI data across
time. Furthermore, I feel the field of Visualization is more strongly driven
towards Interdisciplinary collaborations these days, especially as the
technological means by which we use to generate complex and advanced visualizations
has improved over the years. Visualization has become more useful and often times
more critical to the domain researcher in terms of understanding and exploring
their data. The real challenge comes from translating domain knowledge to a
Visualization developer in a way that conveys the importance of the topics to be
visualized. Too often what we as Developers and Researchers would consider
"interesting" is not always shared by the domain expert. In that sense, it is
critical that both parties be on the same page.


I found that I really liked his discussion of the "Creative Archetypes". That is,
Structuralists, Inspirationalists, and Situationalists. I think that a good CST
or application can and perhaps should incorporate all of these components. For
example, for my project "3D Brain View + Time", it is my desire that researchers
can investigate and explore time-dependent MRI data in a structured and organized
way. That is to say, there should be very clear steps in order to load and visualize
information, etc. Likewise, I would hope that through the use of this tool a user
would be inspired by the information and visualization that is being presented to
them and that it might act as a tool in which to involve non-domain experts. To
attract the masses! Of course, said application should also follow convention and
appeal to the leaders of the field as a tool that is both useful and effective at
its intended task.
